# False-cricket
It is one of my academic projects.

The rules of this game is simillar as cricket but style of playing not same.

In this game system will generate some buttons. The user will be able to select one of them.
Suppose, system generates 8 button

1.bold out

2.six

3.single

4.four

5.double

6.caught out

7.wide ball

8.Dot ball


But the user will not be able to see the value untill he/she selects one of them. When user selects a button, the score will be added to the scoreboard. Suppose user selects 5. 5 run will be added to the scoreboard. If 1 is selected another wicket will be fallen of 11 players. 

Other rules are same as real cricket.
